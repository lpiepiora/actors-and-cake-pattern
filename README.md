# Actors and cake pattern

A playground project, which separates actors from services, in order to test actors in separation (unit testing).

Based on [real-world-scala-dependency-injection-di](http://jonasboner.com/2008/10/06/real-world-scala-dependency-injection-di)
by Jonas Boner, where the general description of a cake pattern can be found.
